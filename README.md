Welcome to the CodeLineLogger VS Code Extension! This extension enhances your coding experience by allowing you to seamlessly add line logging statements to your code in various programming languages.

## Features

- **Effortless Line Logging:** With a simple keyboard shortcut, you can wrap the selected line of code in a log statement, making debugging and analysis easier.
- **Multi-Language Support:** CodeLineLogger supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, Ruby, PHP, Go, Swift, Kotlin, C/C++, Rust, TypeScript, Lua, PowerShell, and Perl.
- **Automatic Formatting:** The extension ensures that the log statement retains the original line's indentation, preserving code readability.
- **Smart Log Statements:** Depending on the language and context, CodeLineLogger intelligently adds log statements specific to each language, such as `console.log` in JavaScript, `print` in Python, or `System.out.println` in Java.
- **Selective Logging:** CodeLineLogger detects if the selected line is a function or object and adjusts the log statement accordingly, omitting quotes for non-string values.
- **Semicolon Handling:** The extension takes care of adding or omitting semicolons at the end of log statements based on the language's syntax conventions.
